# Project: MimicMe Chatbot

## Overview
"MimicMe" is a personality-driven chatbot trained on WhatsApp conversations. It echoes user personas, providing engaging and lifelike interactions.

`Note: Since the project has personal details from a chat I wanted to make sure that I adhere to stop leaking personal information due to the nature of this project being developed by me for educational puposes. It was done in a structured manner going over my initial instinct to solve a problem statement and iterated for better efficiency. For this reason, this public repository is only to showcase what I'm developing in my private repository.`

## Privacy and Data Disclaimer
This chatbot project, MimicMe, involves the use of actual WhatsApp chat data, which may contain personal information. As of the preliminary stages of this project, there are no established rules or mechanisms to automatically remove such information. Exercise caution while using and sharing the chat data.

## Use of ChatGPT Disclaimer
Please note that ChatGPT was used for brainstorming, forming agendas, and gaining a bird's eye view of the project. ChatGPT was not used to generate code, and its insights were only utilized for initial project planning purposes only.

## Key Skills Developed
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
  - Applied NLP techniques to analyze and understand WhatsApp chat data.

- **Data Engineering:**
  - Engineered data pipelines for extraction, cleansing, and preprocessing of raw chat exports.

- **MModel training:**
  - Trained a machine learning model for personality-driven chatbot responses.

- **Text Vectorization:**
  - Utilized CountVectorizer for text vectorization in the context of NLP.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

- **Python Programming:**
  - Proficiently used Python for machine learning model development and data manipulation.

- **GitHub:**
  - Maintained version-controlled repositories on GitHub for code transparency and collaboration.
